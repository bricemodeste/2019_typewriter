      "Hello 007, M16 has confirmed the existence of a secret chemical warfare
      facility at the Byelomorye dam, USSR. Its heavily guarded location and
      workings are a cause for major concern. Nerve gas produced there has been
      turning up in the hands of hostile regimes around the world and deals with
      international terrorists are rumored. This facility should be destroyed
      with extreme prejudice." <br />

      The area around the dam is well defended against full scale military
      attack but a long agent stands a much better chance. The easiest way to
      gain entrance to the weapons factory will be to get down the face of the
      dam. Q had an idea about that.
